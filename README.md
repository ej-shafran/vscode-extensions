# Example Project Using VSCODE Extensions

# Extensions List:
\*  more at the bottom

* ## 1. javascript console utils
Adds a keyboard shortcut (default to `CTRL + SHIFT + L`) which write: `console.log()`, and when a variable was selected, adds `console.log(“var: “, var);` 



* ## 2. Auto rename tag
change the opening html/jsx tag, and the closing tag will change parallel (or vice-versa)



* ## 3. ES7 React/.../React-Native Snippet
Words or a combination of letters which when you write in your code, the Intellisense will provide you options from the React Snippet library which, when selected, will open (surprisingly) a SNIPPET

\> *many combinations*



* ## 4. Better comments
colors the comment: ! - red, ? - blue, todo - orange, * - green



* ## 5. Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
When hard to see all the bracket scopes... (colors brackets pairs)

\> *many settings*



* ## 6. CSS peak
With the `ctrl` button pressed, hovering over an html/jsx className/class/id, a peek of the css code will appear



* ## 7. Color Highlight
colors the background of a color-code according to the color



* ## 8. Color Assist
using special comments, will color the background of the selected scope (between the two comments)



* ## 9. Indent rainbow
colors indentations in your code. can be limited to certain file types, for example I suggest to limit it to .scss files



* ## 10. Bookmarks
with keyboard shortcuts, can add/remove/go to next/go to previous/show all/... bookmarks, where your cursor currently is. Plus there's a list of all bookmarks



* ## 11. Split HTML attributes
Splits attributes with props of html/jsx tags, so that each prop is on a new line (or the opposite: puts all attributes on the same line)
