### javascript console utils
Adds a keyboard shortcut (default to `CTRL + SHIFT + L`) which writes: `console.log()`. And when a variable is selected, writes `console.log(“var: “, var);`.


---
### Auto rename tag
When changing the opening html/jsx tag, the closing tag will automaticly change in parallel (vice-versa).


---
### ES7 React/.../React-Native Snippet
Words or a combination of letters which you can write in your code and the VSCode Intellisense will provide you with options from the React Snippet library which, when selected, will open (surprisingly) a SNIPPET.

\> *many combinations*


---
### Better comments
colors the comment: ! - red, ? - blue, todo - orange, * - green, // - strike & grey.

\> *this extention has interesting stuff in it's settings*


---
### Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
When hard to see all the bracket scopes... (colors bracket pairs).

\> *many settings*


---
### CSS peak
With the `ctrl` button pressed, hovering over an html/jsx className/class/id, a peek of the CSS code will appear.


---
### Color Highlight
Colors the background of a color-code according to the color (e.g. #1464d4).


---
### Color Assist
Using special comments, this extention will color the background of the selected scope (between the two comments).

\> *Opening comment: `//#green`, closing comment: `//#`*


---
### Indent rainbow
Colors indentations in your code. Can be limited to certain file types, for example it's nice to limit it to .scss files.


---
### Bookmarks
With keyboard shortcuts, can add/remove/go-to-next/go-to-previous/show all/... bookmarks (according to where your cursor currently is). Plus there's a list of all your bookmarks.


---
### Split HTML attributes
Splits html/jsx tags by attributes, so that each prop is on a new line (or the opposite: puts all attributes on the same line).

**(!)  There are two similar extentions for this, the suggested one is called: 'Split HTML Attributes (Vue, React, Angular)'**
