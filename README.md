> this is an example repository only, an example which will 100% crash if "npm start"ed. so don't

# Extensions List:
\*  More at the bottom.

---
## javascript console utils
Adds a keyboard shortcut (default to `CTRL + SHIFT + L`) which writes: `console.log()`. And when a variable is selected, writes `console.log(“var: “, var);`.


---
## Auto rename tag
When changing the opening html/jsx tag, the closing tag will automaticly change in parallel (vice-versa).


---
## ES7 React/.../React-Native Snippet
Words or a combination of letters which you can write in your code and the VSCode Intellisense will provide you with options from the React Snippet library which, when selected, will open (surprisingly) a SNIPPET.

\> *many combinations*


---
## Better comments
colors the comment: ! - red, ? - blue, todo - orange, * - green.

\> *this extention has interesting stuff in it's settings*


---
## Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
When hard to see all the bracket scopes... (colors bracket pairs).

\> *many settings*


---
## CSS peak
With the `ctrl` button pressed, hovering over an html/jsx className/class/id, a peek of the CSS code will appear.


---
## Color Highlight
Colors the background of a color-code according to the color (e.g. #1464d4).


---
## Color Assist
Using special comments, this extention will color the background of the selected scope (between the two comments).

\> *Opening comment: `//#green`, closing comment: `//#`*


---
## Indent rainbow
Colors indentations in your code. Can be limited to certain file types, for example it's nice to limit it to .scss files.


---
## Bookmarks
With keyboard shortcuts, can add/remove/go-to-next/go-to-previous/show all/... bookmarks (according to where your cursor currently is). Plus there's a list of all your bookmarks.


---
## Split HTML attributes
Splits html/jsx tags by attributes, so that each prop is on a new line (or the opposite: puts all attributes on the same line).

**(!)  There are two similar extentions for this, the suggested one is called: 'Split HTML Attributes (Vue, React, Angular)'**

---

## this is the 'more' part
- SCSS formatter
- shell formatter
- live share
- Polacode (takes nice code pictures)
- Kite AI Code Autocomplete (/ Tabnine) honestly there are quite a few AI autocomplete extentions
- VSCode Progressive Increment
